Dear Tracey Dominic,

Thank you for your request of NOS Hydrographic Data.  The following explains
the format of the data.  Documentation are included on this disk.  The data
you purchased is in the file 42_068.nos.

The data is in a standard ASCII format (40 character) and can be read and 
visualized with any standard editor or program that is capable of accepting
ASCII character data.

In addition, there are two documentation files on the 40-Character record
format. They are NHDFMT.TXT (Record Format) and CARTCODE.TXT (Listing of
Cartographic Codes).  If you have any problems or questions concerning 
the data and/or the retrieval procedure, you can contact me at 
(303) 497-6376 or by E-Mail (tberggren@ngdc.noaa.gov).  




					      Sincerely,
					      
					      LT Todd L. Berggren, NOAA
					      Manager, NOS Hydrographic
					      Database
