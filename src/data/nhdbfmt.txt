                       NOS HYDROGRAPHIC DATA BASE


  THESE DATA WERE COLLECTED BY THE NATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE (NOS, FORMERLY
  THE U.S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY) FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHARTING THE
  COASTAL WATERS AND NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS OF THE UNITED STATES.  DATA
  COLLECTED PRIOR TO 1965 WERE DIGITIZED FROM THE FINAL SURVEY PLOTS.
  ALL OTHER DATA WERE DIGITIZED IN THE FIELD DURING THE SURVEYS.  THE
  NATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL DATA CENTER IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THESE DATA
  FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC

  THE SOUNDINGS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED FOR TIDE OR WATER LEVEL, VESSEL
  DRAFT AND SOUND VELOCITY IN WATER PRIOR TO THE ASSIMILATION INTO
  THE DATA BASE.  ALL SOUNDINGS REPRESENT THE DEPTH AT A SPECIFIC
  TIDAL DATUM.  DIFFERENT TIDAL DATUMS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE
  VARIOUS BODIES OF WATER.

         ATLANTIC AND CARIBBEAN	MEAN LOW WATER
         GULF OF MEXICO			GULF COAST LOW WATER DATUM
         PACIFIC	    		MEAN LOWER LOW WATER
         ALASKA				MEAN LOWER LOW WATER
         GREAT LAKES			LOW WATER DATUM

  FOR OTHER AREAS SUCH AS NAVIGABLE RIVERS AND LAKES, SPECIFIC DATUMS
  ARE ASSIGNED FOR EACH PARTICULAR AREA.

  HORIZONTAL CONTROL FOR THE DATA IS THE NORTH AMERICAN DATUM OF 1927
  (NAD27) EXCEPT FOR THE FOLLOWING SURVEYS WHICH WERE COLLECTED UNDER
  THE NORTH AMERICAN DATUM OF 1983 (NAD83):

              H-10285     ATLANTIC
              H-10286     ATLANTIC
              H-10319     ALASKA

  UNITS OR MEASUREMENT ARE INDICATED BY THE 3 DIGIT CARTOGRAPHIC CODE
  WHICH IS A FIELD IN EACH DATA RECORD.  A COMPLETE LIST OF CARTOGRAPHIC
  CODES USED IN THE DATA BASE IS GIVEN BELOW.

 THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS
