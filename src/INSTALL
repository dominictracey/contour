Installation notes for Contour 0.9.9

Contour has only ever been built on Linux. I have it working on Red Hat 6.2, 7.1 and 7.2.
Assuming you have all the pre-requisites described below, you should just be able to unpack
the tarball and run './configure; make; ./contour' to run the client.

GPS INTEGRATION ---

If you have a GPS that has a serial port connector and is on the supported
list (NMEA-compliant + Earthmate pretty much):

The gpsd source distribution is included in the contour tarball under the gpsd/
directory. If it doesn't configure and build as part of the full configuration
and build, 'cd gpsd; ./configure; make; make install'

I have got a Delorme Earthmate to test with, hooked it up to my serial port 
and started the gpsd daemon with:

./gpsd -s 9600 -p /dev/ttyS0 -T e -l 4500N -L 6800W

You can test its working by telnetting to localhost:2947 (the default port)
with:

telnet localhost 2947

and typing 'R' <enter> to see if you're getting data from your GPS. If that
works you can try the included gps package to look at all the GPS satellites
if you want.

NOTE: If you don't have a GPS, don't worry, its not a requirement to check out
the system.

MOZILLA INTEGRATION

Get the latest version of Mozilla and install it. You can download binary distributions
from http://mozilla.org or get it off of your distribution media. As of this writing, I'm
running milestone 0.9.15, though its worked with versions as early as 0.9.7. If you are
looking for a good place to put it, try /usr/local/mozilla -- this is one of the places the
contour configure script looks for it. If you get your shoe-laces tied together trying to
configure, use the --with-mozilla* options (try ./configure --help to get a list).

Something you have to watch for is the "insecure submission" default that locks up the 
gecko widget. To get around this, find the prefs.js user file (mine is in ~/.contour/mozilla)
and add the line:

user_pref("security.warn_submit_insecure", false);

POSTGRESQL INSTALLATION

I'm using 7.1.3, though I think 6.5.x should be ok. Again, if ./configure gets confused,
you may need to help it with a --with-postgres-lib command line parameter.

Contour integrates with Postgres in two ways. First, the web-server talks to it to store
and display data through the web interface. Second, GPS data sampling is sent straight to
the back-end. The second method is configured through the contour preferences dialog. If the
defaults don't work, you'll need to run the software, edit the connection parameters, save
them and restart the program.

Integrating Apache, PHP and Postgres is described ad nauseum at http://php.org under the
installation documentation.

When you have the database set-up, edit and run the script $INSTALL_DIR/sql/build.sh
to populate the back-end.

GTK

You must have the GTK+ 1.2 or better installed on your system.

FEEDBACK

I'd love to hear of your experiences (good and bad) trying to get this rather complex beast
to run. Drop a line at aquilon@users.sourceforge.net.
