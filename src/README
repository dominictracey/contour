This is version 0.9.9 of Contour, which is to become the client part 
(installed on commercial fishing boats) of a distributed
network of fisheries data collection stations.

Currently, the software takes as input standardized bathymetric data
(1 square degree of samples from the Gulf of Maine is included in the
data directory) and renders a color image of the sea-floor. This will
serve as the foundation of the system that will allow fishing boat captains
to attach catch information to automatically collected GPS and sounding
machine data.

Data collection is done through an embedded gecko widget provided by the 
Mozilla project. You must have a somewhat recent Mozilla build installed.

GPS integration is done through the gpsd daemon, which is included in source
format in the gpsd directory.

The backend database is implemented through PostgreSQL. Once you have a
database setup, you should be able to run the build.sh script in the sql/
directory to initialize the system's data store.

Data submission is done through an Apache/PHP mechanism. The web interface
is included in the htdocs/ directory. Currently you have to hard-code in 
where you run the server in gecko.h.

Once you get all of the above in place, typing ./configure should get you
going. If errors ensue, try ./configure --help to see if you need to point
the configuration script to some of your local components such as Postgres
or Mozilla.
