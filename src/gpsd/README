GENERAL
=======

Gpsd is a user land daemon acting as a liason between a gps or
Loran-C receiver and clients. The receiver is expected to generate
position information as NMEA-0183 sentences, or Rockwell binary format,
although that can be changed.

Gpsd listens on port 2947 for clients requesting position, time,
velocity or altitude information.

Gpsd can take information from the gps and translate it into
something easier to understand for clients.

The client does not have to run on the same computer ;-)
I have a boat connected to the internet (Ricochet modem) runing
gpsd, the maping program runs here at home (no, I will not give
you the boats IP address :-)

There is a sample client included. It is called "gps". It simply connects
to a gpsd and displays satellites in their current position in the sky.
This only works for some GPS receivers!

Gpsd is tested with DeLorme's TripMate, EarthMate and Garmin units.


CREDITS
=======

Nmea_parse.c is modeled after code seen in gpstrans-0.31b by
Carsten Tschach.

Thanks to Bob Lorenzini <hwm@netcom.com> for his testing and feedback.

Thanks goes to Brook Milligan <brook@trillium.NMSU.Edu> for his
efforts to combine gpsd and gpsclient into one package.
He also changed the configuration method from Imake to GNU
autoconf. This made it easy to port the code to YOUR particular
platform.

Derrick J Brashear <shadow@dementia.org> (KB3EGH) added code for the
EarthMate DeLame. He also added "incredibly gross code to output
NMEA sentences" (his own words :-) He also did the first cut at
DGPS support (see http://www.wsrcc.com/wolfgang/gps/dgps-ip.html), 
for the Earthmate.

Curt Mills <BowHunter@mail.com> (WE7U) furthered the dgps support,
writing the portion for other GPS receivers.

Be advised: any bugs in this code are mine, and mine only ;-)

This is as it stands today, July 17 1999.

Actually, some bugs may be mine too now. Sorry.
