19990206 (0.95)
	 Added suport for EarthMate receivers. Since I do not
	 have one, this is untested.
	 If it works, it does the following:
	  You start gpsd with a baudrate of 9600 and give
	  it the -Te option. If gpsd gets the EartMate id it
	  will enable the receiver and then attempt to switch
	  it into NMEA mode.
	  If the EarthMate id is not received, but a binary
	  data header is received, then we will try to switch
	  NMEA too.
19990304 (0.96)
	 Changed EarthMate support. Rockwell binary is now almost properly
	 supported. Only the minimum required information is extracted.
19990717 (0.99)
	 Rockwell binary is now translated to NMEA format, so that
	 clients like gps will work with an EarthMate.
	 Added speedometer application. Thanks to Derrick J Brashear
	 for his work (see README for contact info).
